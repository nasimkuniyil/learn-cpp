# Variables in C++

Varaibles are a container to store datas.It is like a glass, that can store tea, coffee, juice etc. Every variables have a limit that holds maximum amout of data. When we are trying to store big data that is over that limit, it happens `Data Type Overflow`.

- We cannot store multiple data types in a varialbe.
- We cannot change data type of a variable, once we created.
