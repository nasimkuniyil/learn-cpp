# Variables in C++

Varaibles are a container to store datas.It is like a glass, that can store tea, coffee, juice etc. Every variables have a limit that holds maximum amout of data. When we are trying to store big data that is over that limit, it happens `Data Type Overflow`.

- We cannot store multiple data types in a varialbe.
- We cannot change data type of a variable, once we created.

## Variable naming rules

## Data Types in C++

`int` : Integer
`char` : One character
`boolean` : true or false
`float` : Decimal / floating point number ( 4 bytes )
`double` : Decimal / floating point number (8 bytes )

## Operators

`sizeof()` : find size (in bit) of a variable type.

```cpp
    sizeof(int); // signed int : negative and positive integers
    sizeof(unsigned int); // positive integers
```

## Macro Constants

`INT_MIN` : minimum number of signed integer (negative and positive integers).
`INT_MAX` : maximum number of signed integer.
`UINT_MAX` : maximum number of unsigned integer (positive number only).

## Others

- signed integers : -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
- unsigned integers : 0 to 4,294,967,295.
