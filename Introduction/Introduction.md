# Introductions of C++

C++ is a general-purpose programming language. That means we can use it for everywhere, like game, desktop apps, embedded systems etc. It developed in 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup.
C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
The language was updated 5 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23.

## Why Use C++

C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
C++ is fun and easy to learn!
As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

## Difference between C and C++

C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.

The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.
